Sandeep Reddy is a master's student at the University of Washington specializing in Robotics and AI. His research work is focussed on planning and control in building production level quality algorithms for autonomous vehicles. After doing research in multi-robot formation and autonomous navigation at UW-ME, he joined UW-DARPA RACER program in summer 2022 and is currently working on local planning and controls. He completed his undergrad at NIT Warangal, India in 2020 where he led 25-member cross-functional (software, design, suspension, steering, brakes) SAE BAJA off-road racing team.
