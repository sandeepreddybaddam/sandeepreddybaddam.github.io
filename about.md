I graduated from the **University of Washington (UW), Seattle** where I was part of the [Robot Learning Lab](https://robotlearning.cs.washington.edu/), directed by Professor [Byron Boots](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bboots/). As a Research Assistant, I've had the pleasure of working on the [DARPA RACER](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2022-09-16) program, conducting research on robot motion planning and controls for high-speed off-road [level 4 autonomous vehicles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlNOzhza7pg). After graduation, I joined the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, working on the precise navigation problem for [Lunar Rover](https://www.astrobotic.com/lunar-delivery/rovers/cuberover/) autonomous docking, which is prepared for a series of flight missions, in collaboration with NASA. **I am currently a visiting researcher at the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute, working with Professor [Andrea Bajcsy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abajcsy/) on safe human-robot interaction for autonomous driving.** Broadly, my research interests include robot policy learning, safe human-robot interaction, and planning under uncertainty.

Before joining UW, my undergraduate years at **NIT Warangal**, India, culminated in my leadership of a multifaceted [SAE BAJA off-road racing team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLZzWODQK2A), comprising 25 individuals spanning software, simulation, and hardware domains. You are invited to explore my work below.
