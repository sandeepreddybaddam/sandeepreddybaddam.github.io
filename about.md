Sandeep Reddy is a master's student at the University of Washington specializing in Robotics and AI. His research work is focussed on planning and control in building production level quality algorithms for autonomous vehicles. After doing research in multi-robot formation and autonomous navigation at UW-ME, he joined UW-DARPA RACER program in summer 2022 and is currently working on local planning and controls. He completed his undergrad at NIT Warangal, India in 2020 where he led 25-member cross-functional (software, design, suspension, steering, brakes) SAE BAJA off-road racing team. Then, he worked for seven months on algorithm-based design optimization at Bajaj Auto Ltd., an automobile company in India. With the skills and experience he obtained so far, he would like to apply them to deal critical problems in projects through creativity.

You are invited to explore his work below.

### Work Experience

**Research Assistant | Robot Learning Lab, Paul G. Allen School of CSE, UW** *(Sep. 2022 - Present)*
- Carrying out Inverse Reinforcement Learning to autotune the planner cost function parameters that can save  3-5 manual hours
- Implemented parallel version for cross-track error in MPC-based local planning that is 115X faster than serial computation
- Developed motion planning debugging tools to understand the planner decisions quantitatively using expert demonstrations

**Software and Field Test Engineering Intern | DARPA RACER Program, University of Washington** *(Jun. 2022 – Sep. 2022)*
- Worked on motion planning and control for Level 4 autonomous high-speed off-road vehicle
- Contributing algorithms to safely handle vehicle attitude (roll, pitch) in a model predictive local planner and autonomy status
- Executed a logic to speedup manual takeover by approximately 0.5 sec

**Graduate Student Researcher | Ultra Precision Controls Laboratory, University of Washington** *(Dec. 2021 – Jun. 2022)*
- Wrote an obstacle avoidance algorithm that uses 2D LiDAR point cloud  to maintain multi-robot formation during navigation
- Worked on A* search and CUDA-based Depth Estimation using Stereovision that is 57X faster than the serial version
- Implemented Feedback Linearization based trajectory planning for non-linear models using self-made control tuning UI

**Research & Development, Graduate Trainee Engineer | Bajaj Auto Ltd., Pune, India** *(Jan. 2021 – Jul. 2021)*
- Designed and validated a technique to find the precise cabin volume of any closed car with an accuracy of 98%
- Wrote an optimization algorithm to find best HVAC design parameters and experimented  in real-time on different cars which resulted in validation accuracy > 95%

**Captain, Designer, Driver– SAE BAJA off-road racing team | NIT Warangal** *(Apr. 2017 - Feb. 2020)*
- Managed a 25-member cross-functional (software, design, suspension, steering, brakes) team in building a light off-road vehicle
- Used IoT and Matlab’s ThingSpeak to develop graphical visualization in getting the running status of the vehicle during race
- Improved chassis design using grid independent technique and achieved overall weight under 150kg maintaining min. fos of 1.8
