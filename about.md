Sandeep Reddy is currently a Robotics AI Intern at Bosch Center for AI, formulating optimal control strategies under sensor uncertainties for [Lunar Rover](https://www.astrobotic.com/lunar-delivery/rovers/cuberover/). His research at the **University of Washington** and beyond is dedicated to robot motion planning and controls, policy learning, and planning under uncertainty, aimed towards robot autonomy. During his tenure at UW [Robot Learning Lab](https://robotlearning.cs.washington.edu/) as a Research Assistant, Sandeep was part of prestigious [DARPA RACER](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2022-09-16) program on building high-speed off-road [level 4 autonomous vehicles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlNOzhza7pg). Since the summer of 2022, he has passionately contributed to the domain of local planning and controls. 

Sandeep's journey isn't solely defined by academia; he brings with him a diverse background. His undergraduate years at **NIT Warangal**, India, culminated in his leadership of a multifaceted [SAE BAJA off-road racing team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLZzWODQK2A), comprising 25 individuals spanning software, design, suspension, steering, and brakes domains. Before joining UW, Sandeep lent his expertise to Bajaj Auto Ltd., an eminent automobile company in India. Over a period of seven months, he immersed himself in algorithm-based design optimization, fostering innovation. With the skills and experience he obtained so far, he would like to apply them to deal critical problems in projects through creativity.

You are invited to explore his work below.
