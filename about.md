I am a graduate student at the University of Washington specializing in Robotics and AI. My research work is focussed on planning and control in building production level quality algorithms for autonomous vehicles. I believe my approach in providing efficient solutions at the right time defines me the most over my academic excellence and merit scholarships. With the skills and experience I have obtained so far, I like to apply them to deal critical problems in projects through creativity. I can confidently say that I am organized and flexible to work independently as well as in a team.
