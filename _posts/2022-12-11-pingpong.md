### Game Description :
In general, the ping pong game is played by two players. In our case, one being a human agent
or hard coded AI opponent and the other being the RL agent. The game has two horizontal
boundaries and two vertical boundaries. An agent is present on the side of each vertical
boundary. In the initial environment, the ball gets generated on a center point of the vertical line
which is midway between the two vertical boundaries. Each player has to hit the ball and if a
player misses to hit the ball, it exceeds the game area, the other player gets one point. Now a
new ball is generated at the center line again. The game continues until we quit or a player
reaches a specified maximum score.
