1. Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Off-road Autonomy (research)
   - DARPA-funded RACER Program on building high-speed [level 4 autonomous vehicles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlNOzhza7pg)
2. [Pong AI Player](https://sandeepreddybaddam.github.io/pingpong/)
3. [Tetris AI Player](https://github.com/sandeepreddybaddam/tetris_ncem_ai_player)
4. Multi-robot Formation and Autonomous Navigation (6-month project)
   - PI: Prof. Santosh Devasia
   - See **[here](https://sandeep240599.wixsite.com/website?pgid=l477fsfe-ec167491-1d4f-45e0-a003-94f616a6386d)** how robots follow each other and **[here](https://sandeep240599.wixsite.com/website?pgid=l477fsfe-fe15f482-e12c-4aa1-9cf0-4d4d3d4a8abd)** how they do formation
   - Made robots track each other and platoon in line, configurable triangle using fiducial tagging and sensor fusion techniques
   - Built state-space models for different objectives and used 2 linear operators to obtain accurate and stable formation
   - Executed Hand-gesture Controlled Mobile Robot using OpenCV and Googleâ€™s Mediapipe that can eliminate joystick teleop
